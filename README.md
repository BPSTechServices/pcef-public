Per the requirements list:

Must have
•	Ability to save and come back to application, review and submit Ok
•	Skip pattern Ok
•	Select one or more application types (mini, small, planning, large) Ok
•	Ability to download application into fillable form Not doable. Users can download any of the three applications. These will need to be pre-formed pdfs. There will be no upload option once the forms are submitted.
•	Icon with hover text explainers Ok
•	Report download in csv and pdf Ok
Would be nice to have
•	Multiple users on same application This isn’t doable in the time allowed. Frankly it’s not doable with the current infrastructure that this application will live on. It would require a purchase of cloud infrastructure and much R&D. We’re essentially talking about a private, custom, google docs experience. Resources simply don’t allow.
•	Pull from different inputs to calculate ouput Ok
•	Ability to read and make notes Read—Ok. Notes --  Ok if only for staff. Not doable for non-city staff… potentially doable if it’s a group of pre-identified people that is unlikely to change much
•	Look and feel Vague but ok

All below is phase two:

Future scoring interface
•	Staff control of assigning grants for review to multiple scorers Ok but also needs thought into identity access management (IAM). This is a decision point considering you have non-pdx reviewers
•	Scorer access only to those applications they are assigned ok but see above
•	Place for scorers to put scores ok but see above
•	Ability to read and make notes ok but see above
•	Scores only visible to staff ok
•	Report generation pulling from defined fields in scoring interface and application interface ok
